<h2><a name="particletheory"></a>Particle Theory - Introduction</h2>
<p>The kinetic theory of matter (particle theory) says that all matter consists 
  of many, very small particles which are constantly moving or in a continual 
  state of motion. The degree to which the particles move is determined by the 
  amount of energy they have and their relationship to other particles. The particles 
  might be atoms, molecules or ions. Use of the general term 'particle' means 
  the precise nature of the particles does not have to be specified.</p>
<p> Particle theory helps to explain properties and behaviour of materials by 
  providing a model which enables us to visualise what is happening on a very 
  small scale inside those materials. As a model it is useful because it appears 
  to explain many phenomena but as with all models it does have limitations. </p>

<p><i>Why do you think that the same volume of different materials have differing 
  masses</i> <br>
  E.g. 1cm3 of gold weighs 19.3g but 1cm3 of aluminium weighs 2.7g</p>
